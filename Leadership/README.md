## Contacting Club Members

Historically, club members have primarily been contacted via an email list maintained by the member of club leadership responsible for sending out meeting reminders (president or secretary). If you add people in the To section in Outlook, you can copy and paste the whole list of email contacts. People's names/emails are seperated by semicolons. Copying from Outlook by default will not include any new lines (just uses semicolons to seperate names), but it can be helpful to insert a new line to your email list to quickly add or delete members. An example of what this looks like is included below
```text
"John Doe" <jdoe@zagmail.gonzaga.edu>; 
"Jane Smith" <jsmith@zagmail.gonzaga.edu>; 
```
This was stored as a text document locally on a leadership member's computer. Going forward, it might serve to periodic upload the most recent version of this list to Teams. This list is generally larger than the Zagtivities roster, with non-active members only being removed if they specifically asked to be.

Emails to club members have historically come from the email account of the person sending out those emails. Going forward, it might be better to send out emails from a club managed email account, such as [GURobotics@zagmail.gonzaga.edu](mailto:GURobotics@zagmail.gonzaga.edu) (see [Club Managed Accounts](#club-managed-accounts) for where to find the login).

**A reminder email should be sent to the whole club roster before any (general) meeting or event**.


## Member Recruitment and Retention


## Funding

Generally, there are two sources of funds available that can be accessed, [GSBA funds](#gsba-funds) and [SEAS funds](#seas-funds).

### GSBA Funds
Heed the following warning:

**GSBA does not share your values or the club's. They do not share your work ethic. They do not have your technical knowledge. They do not share your sense of urgency, your deadlines, or your level of commitment to this club. Never assume they'll show initiative, especially with regards to club funding.**

That being said,

GSBA will give up to $3,000 to clubs, subject to several restrictions.
- no more than 50% of this can be spent on travel
-
This list may be incomplete or out of date. Always refer to the most recent GSBA funding guidelines before making decisions. I'm not aware of where these can be found online, but a paper copies can be found in the CSI office (Hemmingson 304).

To obtain some of these funds from GSBA, submit a **funding** request. GSBA policy is to automatically deny purchase requests submitted from SEAS clubs. This is because purchase requests are intended for clubs to use money that GSBA *stores* for them to buy items, rather than request funding. As a SEAS club, SEAS holds on to our money, not GSBA (see the [SEAS Funds](#seas-funds) section of this document for more information). This information is not included on the current GSBA funding guidelines document. Funding requests are (supposed to be) deliberated on Mondays at 5:30PM in a private meeting. If a funding request exceeds $2,100, this is instead deliberated by the GSBA Senate, which meets publically. GSBA has estimated a 2-3 week response time for funding requests under $2,100, and about a month or more for requests in excess of $2,100. **It's strongly recommended to stay under $2,100 for funding requests.** If it's necessary to exceed this, consider going to the public GSBA senate meetings to determine whether the request has been deliberated on and justify our request.

GSBA is often a bit of a black box where it's unclear if funding requests have even been deliberated, and they generally will not let you know when they begin ordering. Historically, requests in the description of funding requests and in a text box on the spreadsheets attached to funding requests for club members to be emailed ETA's have been repeatedly ignored. If you want to know the status of these, you essentially have to follow up in person, although you can also try emailing [Andrew Mercer](mailto:mercer@gonzaga.edu), GSBA's Program Coordinator, who generally responds to emails. Historically, the Club Funding Coordinator (student position) has not responded to emails they were sent or CC'ed on.

GSBA will not reimburst you for purchases made prior to approval of a funding request. If you do buy anything in person, they prefer you use a GSBA card and return a receipt to them. If you do get approval to use this card, coordinate with GSBA when to return the card and bring them receipts for everything purchased.


### SEAS Funds

SEAS stores various gift funds for GU Robotics, which is where money donated to the club typically goes.

SEAS funds are significantly easier to access than GSBA funds. If you need items fast, it's likely better to use SEAS funds. [Richard Keroak](mailto:keroack@gonzaga.edu) is the person to get in contact with to determine how much funds we have left in our gift fund accounts and to actually spend that money. He generally responds to emails around 24 hours after they're sent to him, and will give you actual pricing and ETA's on parts if you ask him to.

It's been indicated that there is an option for reimburstment for purchases spent through a form (potentially for purchases made *before* approval for the funding) at a SEAS Club Council meeting, but I'm not aware of where this form can be found or how leninent of reimburstment this is. At this meeting, it was also mentioned [Richard](mailto:keroack@gonzaga.edu) might be able to set up a very low limit P-Card (purchasing card) for clubs. It's recommended for future generations of leadership to follow up on this to enable us to quickly get access to funds for emergency orders (e.g. waiting on just one type of screws that can be bought at the general store).


## Ordering

Whether dealing with GSBA or SEAS, it's best practice to have an organized spreadsheet or other document to begin purchasing. You should be able to pull from prior funding requests and purchase order lists to get a template and add to it. Some vendors and suppliers have multiple options for different sizes, ensure there's no ambiguity on which option the person purchasing these should buy.

If you're borrowing a card, keep receipt for every purchase and return those with the card. Consider taking a picture of receipts for internal tracking as well.

Ensure whoever is responsible for purchasing these items has the contact information of someone in club leadership should an item go out of stock or have prohibitive shipping costs.

### Fundraising
Paraphrasing [Beau](mailto:grillo@gonzaga.edu), "It's the organized clubs that get the funding."

Guidelines for fundraising and crowdfunding (for Gonzaga clubs in general and SEAS clubs more specifically) can be found in the SEAS Club Council [Teams files](https://gonzagau.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/SEASClubCouncil/Shared%20Documents/General/Club%20Fundraising?csf=1&web=1&e=89id1r).

When requesting funds, include a description of how much money is being requested/is desired, and where this money would be going. Donors want to know that how they're helping out a club, so tie funding amounts to concrete objectives. Be sure to thank donors for their support, mentioning how their funding has been helpful.

Fundraising is by no means not a solved problem by the leadership team of today. Below is list of potential options to raise funds (aside from GSBA funding requests).

### SEAS Club Council
Funds can be raised by petitioning the SEAS Club Council. We've had successful funding proposals during the 2023-2024 year and 2024-2025 year, the later of which is documented on our [Teams files](https://gonzagau.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/GonzagaRobotics-Leadership/Shared%20Documents/Leadership/SEAS_CPC_Funding_Proposal_Documents_04_28_2025?csf=1&web=1&e=rK04LX).

The current (2024-2025) SEAS Club Funding Allocation Policy can be found [online](https://gonzagau.sharepoint.com/sites/SEASClubCouncil/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=XFC9lh&CID=2e19b75f%2D4636%2D4d20%2Da698%2Dd998428232a4&FolderCTID=0x01200055D6A8CA24FCCA4988D7FF8989A98989&id=%2Fsites%2FSEASClubCouncil%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2F2024%2D2025%20Club%20Council%2FSEAS%20Club%20Council%20Funding%20Policy%20%2D%20Revised%203%2D25%2D24%2Epdf&viewid=f14e05b2%2D05b9%2D4009%2Db508%2D707a5ddf0675&parent=%2Fsites%2FSEASClubCouncil%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2F2024%2D2025%20Club%20Council), and requires the following:
- active participation in SEAS club councils 
    - someone from GU Robotics should be attending every SEAS club council, so this should be a non-issue 
- exhausing 75% of the GSBA funding (75% of $3,000) or having a funding request that exceeds GSBA funding balance 

Note that these requirements may have changed over the years, and you should always read over the most recent SEAS Club Funding Allocation Policy prior to formally starting a funding proposal.


### Donor Letters

Donor letters are sent out by University Advancement, and require a review process to be followed before they can be sent out. This process can take a long time, so the decision to send out a donor letter should be made at the beginning of the year. University Advancement is responsible for generating a list of donors that the letter can be sent to. The letter can be sent through email and/or physically mailed out, and we have the option to chose to only mail out physical copies to donors who are more likely to donate. We are also able to include items such as stickers in mailed donor letters. Note that physically mailing these letters costs money.

The team has sent out donor letters during the 2023-2024 school year and the 2024-2025 school year.

### Restaurant Fundraisers

Several nearby restaurants have systems in place for school club fundraising where the club receives a portion of the profits. 

[Caruso's](https://www.ilovecarusos.com/spokane-valley-fundraising) has a system where the club will receives funds for every order people place if they mention they're with GU Robotics (even if they use Bulldog bucks) for a night, so long as 20 people RSVP to confirm they'll be there to support the club. The club has used Caruso's for fundraising in the 2023-2024 year.

[Panda Express](https://community.pandaexpress.com/fundraisers) also has fundraising systems in place, but (to my knowledge) we've never fundraised with them before.

There are likely other nearby restaurants that have similar fundraising schemes.



## Inventory

We do, in fact, have stuff. Some of what we own is even written down for internal use.

## Club Managed Accounts

GU Robotics manages several email and social media accounts.

## Service Events

GSBA requires the club to volunteer together for (at least) 2 hours every semester, and to record these on Zagtivities. Club members can record their own service hours, or club leadership can do it for them. If club leadership records service hours, they are automatically approved. In Zagtivities, click on the GU Robotics icon and click 'Service Hours' in the pop-up menu. Then click 'Add Service Hours' to log hours for club members.

## Beginning of Year Actions

Here is a working list of what club leadership will need to do at the beginning of the year:

- Request lab access for *all* labs
    - [Daniel Clark](mailto:clarkd@gonzaga.edu) is generally responsible for managing lab access
    - Labs to request
        - Herak 104A 
        - Bollier Wet Project's Lab
            - may require a Hazardous Use Form to be submitted to [Wade Croft](mailto:croft@gonzaga.edu) prior to chemical testing 
            - may also require coordinating with Risk Managment for waste disposal after chemical testing
    - Upload all relevant forms for lab access on Teams under General files -> "Lab Use"
    - Create walkthrough for club members to request access for lab spaces
- Fill out a Club Advisor form, file it with GSBA
- Ensure we're registered for the club fair 
    - this is how we the majority of our members hear about us 
    - Oftentimes, the event organizers run out of tables, so try to register early in case that helps us get one and be prepared to bring a table as a backup


## Transitions

When leadership teams change or leadership members graduate/transfer or new people join the leadership team, the following actions may be required:

- Update Zagtivities to reflect new leadership
- Write a transition document for new leadership members
    - Please include at least the following:
        - Lessons learned during leadership
        - Where applicable guides, documentation, records, account logins, contact information, etc. can be found
    - GSBA tries to require one done at end of year, but hasn't always shown up under files in the past
        - can find under club files on Zagtivities
- Update Zagtivities to include new constitution (this is already a part of re-registering the club)
- Changing confirmation emails and phone numbers for club managed accounts if they're set with 
- Ensure new leadership members are added to the Leadership channel on the GU Robotics teams, and have access to the files
    - sometimes, Teams adds people as a 'guest,' and they're unable to edit files
- Ensure new leadership members are added to the seperate leadership chat with full history

This is not an exhaustive list, and there will undoubtably be more things to consider and act on.
